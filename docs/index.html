            <p>
                This project creates a model architecture for a Convolutional Neural
                Network that could predict whether an X-ray Image showed a Fractured
                or UnFractured Bone. Training accuracy of 99% &amp; 98% and Validation
                accuracy of 74.2% &amp; 77.8% were obtained respectively from the 2
                models generated.

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                The Dataset was provided off VUPPALA ADITHYA SAIRAM on Kaggle (
                <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vuppalaadithyasairam/bone-fracture-detection-using-xrays</a>
                ). Data was already split into Training and Validation set, with each
                one containing a roughly equal number of fractured and nonfractured
                X-ray images. Within each folder, there are a series of images along
                with their variants rotated in the third dimension. Images are 224 by
                224 pixels in size.

        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>

            <h3>Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>Due to the relatively small size of the dataset provided, Data Augmentation was introduced to provide
                more robustness to the model. The Image-inputs generated from the Dataset are changed via the
                ImageDataGenerator object 'image_datagen'. Rotation, shear, zoom, flip, and height/width transformations
                are all altered in the Dataset to provide more variance and improve the model's ability to generalize.
            </p>

            <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>After Inputting the Image data, a Rescaling Layer is applied to scale the rbg data values down from 0-255
                to a float value between 0-1. This normalization of data is seen throughout the Model through Batch
                Normalization Layers to prevent previously observed internal covariate shifts and vanishing/exploding
                gradients.</p>
            <p>Convolution Layers with Pooling Layers are applied to extract image features. General kernal_size of 3x3
                was used, along with the rectified linear activation function.</p>
            <p>After a flattening layer, a series of fully connected layers are used to extrapolate to an eventually
                classification (Fractured or not).</p>
            <p>Dropout was interwoven within the fully-connected layers to introduce variance and encourage more use of
                all the nodes.</p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>Data was trained using Binary-CrossEntropy as the loss function and the Adam optimizer.</p>
            <p>Hyperparameters were tuned using 2 types of callbacks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ModelCheckpoint - saves the best model based on validation accuracy while training. This way, we
                    have access to a model that wouldn't be overfit if the epochs are too large</li>
                <li>Reduce LR on Plateau - reduces the learning rate by 10% if the validation loss doesn't decrease
                    after 20% of the total number of epochs. This will help stabilize a node and prevent increased
                    change from new backpropagation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="" Validation>
            <h2>Validation</h2>
            <p>Running the best model (saved from ModelCheckpoint) and the complete model (saved at the end of running
                all epochs) returns an accuracy on the validation dataset of 77.8% and 74.2% respectively.</p>
            <p>Running the models on the training dataset returns 98%-99% accuracy, indicating some degree of
                overfitting.</p>

            <h2>Potential Next Steps For this Project</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Implement Cross-Validation as another marker to judge model efficacy.</li>
                <li>Tune more HyperParameters to prevent overfitting, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Add/Modify/Remove Layers to further improve accuracy.</li>
                        <li>Adding L1 or L2 Regularization Layers.</li>
                        <li>Modifying the Kernel sizes (i.e. 5x5).</li>
